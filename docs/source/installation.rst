Installation
============

1. Install the following packages for example with conda:

	>>> conda install python numpy scipy pandas cython cartopy matplotlib=2

   (At the moment, you need matplotlib 2 as pcolormesh is not working with the
   current cartopy release. But it will be hopefully updated soon.)

2. Install cdflib with pip:

    >>> pip install cdflib

3. Finally install chaosmagpy-x.x (replace 'x' with version) from the archive:

	>>> pip install chaosmagpy-x.x.tar.gz
