Installation
============

1. Install the following packages for example with conda:

	>>> conda install python numpy scipy pandas cython cartopy matplotlib<3

   (At the moment, you need matplotlib 2 as pcolormesh is not working with the
   current cartopy release. But it will be hopefully updated soon.)

2. Install cdflib with pip:

    >>> pip install cdflib

3. Finally install ChaosMagPy either with pip:

    >>> pip install chaosmagpy

   or, if you downloaded the package files, with:

	>>> pip install chaosmagpy-x.x.tar.gz

   replacing `x` with the correct version.
